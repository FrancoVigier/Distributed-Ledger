# Distributed-Ledger
Distributed ledger (decentralized blockchain) and consensus algorithms, subject OS I

Based on the algorithm proposed in "Formalizing and Implementing Distributed Ledger Objects" 
(Anta, Georgiou, Konwar and Nicolaou 2018) and the algorithm "ISIS algorithm for total ordering of messages" 
we give an implementation of a distributed ledger that supports adding objects (records) and reading the current state
(the list of records). This ledger has atomic consistency guarantees and is resistant to failures on the part of the servers 
that maintain it.

The report explains at the end how to run the ledger.
